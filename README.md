# Dynamic Array
The assignment is to write a function in C++ that dynamically allocates an array of integers, fills it with user input, then prints the sum of that array. 

## How I did the assignment
The idea is to allcoate a random size (I chose 5) and let the user input their numbers. Then create a loop to print the array and calculate them all. Such as: 
```C++
sum += arr[i];
```

### Output window
```
Index 1: 30
Index 2: 20
Index 3: 10
Index 4: 40
Index 5: 60
Array: 30 20 10 40 60
Sum: 160
```
